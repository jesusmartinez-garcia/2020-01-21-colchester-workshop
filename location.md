The ninth GAP Days will take place in [Halle
(Saale)](http://www.halle.de/en/Home) in the [Institute of Computer
Science](https://www.informatik.uni-halle.de) of the [Martin Luther University
of Halle-Wittenberg](https://www.uni-halle.de), which next to the [Institute of
Mathematics](https://www.mathematik.uni-halle.de). Please see below, and the
[program page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/program), for the specific
details about which rooms are available for our use on which days.

<h2>Address</h2>

<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.49632/11.93494">
Institut für Informatik<br />
Von-Seckendorff-Platz 1<br/>
06120 Halle (Saale)</a>

<h2>Rooms</h2>

The main base for the GAP Days will be **rooms 5.09 and 5.10**, on the fifth
floor of Von-Seckendorff-Platz 1. However, this room is unavailable on Wednesday
20<sup>th</sup> March. Instead we will be based in room 1.30 on the Wednesday,
which on the first floor.

Throughout the GAP Days, we will also have access to **seminar rooms 1.02 and
1.03**, on the first floor.  These rooms will be useful for those who wish to
have meetings or discussions that are not relevant to the whole group.

<h2>Getting around Halle</h2>

Halle has an extensive tram network, which is the best way for visitors to get
around Halle, especially those staying at the TRYP hotel ([see below](#ticket)).
Von-Seckendorff-Platz 1 is a two minute walk away from the _**tram stop
Straßburger Weg**_. Information about times and fares can be accessed via the
[easy.GO webapp](https://app.myeasygo.de), or via the native easy.GO apps for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.easygo) and iOS.

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

We recommend that you stay at the <a href="https://www.tryphalle.com/">TRYP by
Wyndham Halle</a>.

<a name="ticket"></a>At check-in, you will been given a complimentary ticket
which gives you unlimited travel on Halle's public transport for the duration of
your visit.  The closest tram stop to the TRYP hotel is _**Zentrum Neustadt**_,
which can be reached from the main railway station in 20 minutes by line 9.
Note that, since you do not receive your free ticket until check-in, you will
need to purchase single ticket (2.30 Euro) for this journey.  To travel from
*Zentrum Neustadt* to *Straßburger Weg* for the GAP Days, it is necessary to
change trams at *Rennbahnkreuz*.

The organisers had negotiated a special offer for participants of GAP Days
Spring 2019, but this offer has now expired. However, there are still rooms
available at normal rates.

<h2>Restaurants</h2>

Halle is a city of around 240,000 people, so there is a reasonably large variety
of restaurants and bars in the city. Kleine Ulrichstraße has a particularly high
concentration of decent restaurants and bars, so it would be a good place to
start if you want to see what you fancy. **Please bring cash to restaurants and
bars**; there is likely only a small chance that foreign cards will be
accepted.
